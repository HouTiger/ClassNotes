## 1. 
* Let {$p_n$} be the sequence defined by $p_n = \sum_{k = 1}^n {\frac{1}{k}}$. Show that {$p_n$} diverges even though $lim_{n\to\infty}{(p_n - p_{n - 1}) = 0}$ 



## 2.
* The fuction defined by $f(x) = sin(\pi x)$ has zeros at every integer. Show that when $-1 < a < 0$ and $2 < b < 3$，the Bisection method converges to
* a. $0$. if $a + b < 2$
* b. $2$. if $a + b > 2$
* c. $1$. if $a + b = 2$ 

## 3. 
* Let $W(x)$ be the Wilkinson polynomial. 
    * (a) Prove that $W^\prime(16) = 15!4!$
    * (b) Find an analogous formula for $W^\prime(j)$, where j is an integer between 1 and 20

## 4. 
* Suppose that g is continuously differentiable on some interval $(c, d)$ that contains the fixed point $p$ of $g$. Show that if $|g^\prime(p)| < 1$, then there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that if $|p_0 - p| \le \delta$, then the fixed-point iteration converge
